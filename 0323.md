Proof: 
$$
w \in W \text{ is achievable for } f \in F \text{ if there exists a stable matching s.t.  } \mu(f)=w 
$$
$$
\text{Claim: In the firm proposing algorithm, no firm is ever rejected by an achievable worker of this firm. --  proposition 2}  
$$

Proof by induction as the steps of the algorithm.

- In step 1, true
- Assuming true for steps $$ \leq k $$, show true in step k.
- Step 1: otherwise, some firm is rejected by an achievable worker w. Let $$ \mu  $$ be a stable matching s.t. $$ \mu (f) = w $$. w rejects f -- w receives a better offer. Let f' be the best offer w receives. 
$$
f' \gt _{ m } f 
$$

From the algorithm, w is on top of the preference list of f'. Then $$ w \gt _{ f' } \mu (f') $$ 
$$
\Longrightarrow (f',w) \text{ is a blocking pair for } \mu. 
$$

Assume no firm has been rejected by an achievable worker up to 80 excluding step k, need to show that no firm is going to be rejected by an achievable work in step k.

Suppose some $$ f \in F $$ is rejected by an achievable worker $$ w \in W $$ in step k.
Let $$ \mu  $$ be a stable matching s.t. $$ \mu (f)=w $$.
Let $$ f' $$ be the best offer w has received up to and including step k.
$$
\text{then } f' \gt _{ w } f
$$
Moreover, $$ f' $$ has not yet proposed to $$ w' = \mu \left( f' \right)  $$, implying
$$
w \gt_{ f' }   w' \\
\Longrightarrow (f',w) \text{ is a blocking pair for } \mu  \Longrightarrow \text{ contradiction } 
$$

## Rural Hostpical Theorem

### Proposition 3: When preferences are strict, the set of agents who are matched in a given market is the same for all stable matchings
$$
\mu (w) \Longrightarrow \mu (W) \text{ = all firms that are matched under } \mu \\
\mu (f) \Longrightarrow \mu (F) \text{ = all workers that are matched under } \mu . 
$$
$$
\left| \mu (W) \right| \text{ : number of matched firms }  \\
\left| \mu (F) \right| \text{ : number of matched workers } \\
\left| \mu (w) \right| = \left| \mu (F) \right| \\
$$
$$
\text{Claim: } \mu ^{ F } (W) \supseteq \mu ^{ W } (W)
$$
*meaning of power: under optimal*
*e.g. $$ \mu^{ W }  $$: set of the matched firm under worker optimal condition*

$$
\text{ Suppose some } f \in \mu ^{ W } (W) \text{ \ } \mu ^{ F } (W) 
$$
*meaning of \ : in the former but not in the latter set*
Therefore, $$ f $$  is matched unter $$ \mu ^{ w }  $$ but alone / unmatched under \mu ^{ F } .
