## Efficient matching

Proof: 
$$
w \in W \text{ is achievable for } f \in F \text{ if there exists a stable matching s.t.  } \mu(f)=w 
$$
$$
\text{Claim: In the firm proposing algorithm, no firm is ever rejected by an achievable worker of this firm. --  proposition 2}  
$$

Proof by induction as the steps of the algorithm.

- In step 1, true
- Assuming true for steps $$ \leq k $$, show true in step k.
- Step 1: otherwise, some firm is rejected by an achievable worker w. Let $$ \mu  $$ be a stable matching s.t. $$ \mu (f) = w $$. w rejects f -- w receives a better offer. Let f' be the best offer w receives. 
$$
f' \gt _{ m } f 
$$

From the algorithm, w is on top of the preference list of f'. Then $$ w \gt _{ f' } \mu (f') $$ 
$$
\Longrightarrow (f',w) \text{ is a blocking pair for } \mu. 
$$

Assume no firm has been rejected by an achievable worker up to 80 excluding step k, need to show that no firm is going to be rejected by an achievable work in step k.

Suppose some $$ f \in F $$ is rejected by an achievable worker $$ w \in W $$ in step k.
Let $$ \mu  $$ be a stable matching s.t. $$ \mu (f)=w $$.
Let $$ f' $$ be the best offer w has received up to and including step k.
$$
\text{then } f' \gt _{ w } f
$$
